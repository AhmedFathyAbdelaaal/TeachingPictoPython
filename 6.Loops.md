## **1. What is Looping?

A loop is a way to repeat a block of code multiple times without writing the same code again. Loops are used when you need to execute the same set of instructions repeatedly.
**Types of Loops**:

- **For Loop**: Repeats a block of code a specific number of times or over a collection of items.
- **While Loop**: Repeats a block of code while a condition remains `True`.
- **Do While**: Although Python doesn't have a native `do-while` loop, we can mimic it using a `while` loop.
you want to print out things multiple times, loops are the thing for you.

## **2. For Loop

This loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a block of code. It's ideal for iterating over sequences like lists, strings, or ranges.
how it looks like would be like this:
```
for item in sequence:
    # Code to execute
```
and an example of this in practice would look like this:
```
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello!")
```
so here, the item is i, and the sequence is range(5). using range 5 means the loop will repeat 5 times. another example to best show what item is in the for loop would be like this.
```
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
in this code, at every loop it will print i, the item and what it is. So, if we run this code we get
```
0
1
2
3
4
```
you can see that it start with 0 and goes to 4, which shows us that the way range(n) works is that it repeats the number of times in the range but the items start from 0 and not 1. this follows all of coding principles as generally lists in coding start with 0 and not 1.

the loop above then with the Hellos will print Hello 5 times.

## **3. While Loop

This loop keeps running as long as a condition is `True`. It's useful when you don't know exactly how many iterations you need, but you want the loop to continue until a condition is met.

This is different from for loops because for loops generally have a set amount of iteration they do, like you define a range or later on we will learn how to provide it with lists to go through. But sometimes we cant know how many times something should run, so While loops are used for those scenarios.

While loops look something like this:
```
while condition:
    # Code to execute
```
so if the condition here is true, it will execute the code, and if it isn't, it will stop it.

Here is one problem with while loops, it is easy to get into a loop that never ends. if your condition never fails. the loop will continue looping over and over again until your stop the program. so , we have to make sure it has a condition that eventually ends.

An example of a while loop that ends would be like this:
```
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print("Counter:", counter)
    counter += 1
```

in this code we have a counter, and the counter will be the condition item that we use to end the program once it increases to a certain level. The code to be executed is two things, we print what the counter value is and then we increase the counter by 1

```
Counter:0
Counter:1
Counter:2
Counter:3
Counter:4
```
and that will be the output

## **4. Do While Loop

Lets say we want the loop code to run once atleast before we see if the condition is met, for that we do what is known in other languages as do while loop. python doesnt have it but we can do it using while loops like so:
```
while True:
    #code instruction
    if conditon:
        break
```

Basically, the loop will work once because its true, and the code instruction in the loop should help in making the condition met eventually. The condition is what will eventually lead to the 'break' function that breaks out of the loop.

Break can be used in any loop actually to exit the loop forcefully.

an example of the code above would be something like this:
```
while True:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if number > 10:
        break
```
That loop will ask the user to enter a number, if the user ever enters a number bigger than 10, the loop will end. if the user enters anything less than 10, it will keep on repeating as long as the user wants.

## **5. More range Info

in for loops when you use range there are other ways you can edit it to give you a more customizable selection of numbers. you don't have to only use it in the form of 'range(n)'

you can also use it in the form of 'range(n,m)' where the range will start at n and goes to the number right before m. 
(similar to how range(5) goes from 0 to 4. range(5) is actually just like range(0,5))

so an example would be:
```
for i in range(1,10):
	print(i)
```
will print from 1 to 9.

we can use this with conditionals to differentiate numbers.

Lets say we can find even numbers and odd numbers in a list of numbers:
```
for i in range (1,11):
	if i % 2 ==0:
		print("Even: ", i)
	else:
		print("Odd: ", i)
```

and this program uses conditionals and the operator modulus we learned before to show even and odd numbers.

we can also use variable variables to dictate the range like this:
```
n = int(input("Enter the length of the range: "))

for i in range(n):
	print(i)
```

### **6. Homework**

- Write a program that:
    - Uses a loop to print all numbers from 1 to 100.
    - If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
    - If it's divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
    - If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
    - Make the ultimate calculator.
