#Lesson

## What will be covered in lessons?

- Explain the interface and how we will use it
- Explain what sprites are
- Explain the Maps
- Explain the sprites movement, with its direction and axis and also its speed
- Explain how to run the game

### **1. The Interface and How We Will Use It**

**Explanation:**

- Introduce the **Pictoblox coding interface**, which allows students to write Python code directly.
- Key areas:
    - **Code Editor**: Where Python code is written.
    - **Stage**: The visual area where the game runs.
    - **Sprites Pane**: Lists the sprites or characters added to the game.
- Walk through how to:
    - Write code to manipulate sprites.
    - Run the code and view the results on the stage.


### **2. Sprites**

**Explanation:**

- Sprites are visual objects or characters in the game that you control through Python code.
- Each sprite can be programmed with different behaviors, like movement or interaction with other sprites.
```
sprite = Sprite('Tobi')
my_sprite.show()
```
We don't need the .show() , but it is good practice to know if we are showing or hiding the sprite in code. and outside of Pictoblox you have to .show()

This code loads a sprite image and shows it on the stage.

"Tobi" is a sprite in the Pictoblox library, others exist too. you can find them from the add button in the entities menu to the bottom right.

Since we are using Pictoblox, we will use their interface to add the sprites and maps later on too because its easier and doesn't introduce errors.

### **3. The Maps**

**Explanation:**

- Maps (or backdrops) represent the game environment.
- Pictoblox allows adding different maps as backgrounds for different game levels.
- Maps are also controlled using Python to set scenes or change environments during gameplay.

```
stage = Sprite('Maze')
```
Pictoblox uses Sprites to also do stages, and they have an editor for them too inside the app itself.

the moment you call it in the code, it will show in the scene you are in. we will use Pictoblox to add the maps, or as they are know, backdrops because its easier and wont case many issues.


### **4. Sprite Movement: Direction and Moving

**Explanation:**

- Sprites move on an x-y axis (horizontal and vertical directions).
    - **x-axis**: Controls horizontal movement.
    - **y-axis**: Controls vertical movement.
- You can control the **movement** and **direction** of the sprite using Python commands.
```
sprite.setdirection(0)
sprite.move(10)
```

'setdirection' uses angles to work, 0 represents up, 90 represents right, 180 represents down and -90 represents left.

move just moves in the direction your are looking. This is why here we set the direction of the sprite, to decide where it will go then we move it however many steps we want it to go.

## **5. Input Time

Lets say you want the sprite to move when you move. well that is possible here, we just have to detect the character input.

There is a function that helps us with that and it is.
```
<nameOfSprite>.isKeyPressed("<Key>")
```
you can see the function "isKeyPressed" is attached to the sprite that it will be over and also it has a condition inside the bracket with the key that is pressed.

the keys can be any keys on your keyboard, including letters or even the space bar. 

```
"w"
"a"
"s"
"d"
"space"
```
are all examples of valid keys.

but thats not the only thing we need here for the key presses. isKeyPressed is a question that returns an answer in the form of a true or false, which means its a conditional which means we need to put it in an if statment which will make it look like this:

```
if <nameOfSprite>.isKeyPressed("<Key>"):
	#Code to be done when key is pressed
```

but if you put something like this in your code:
```
if sprite.isKeyPressed("w"):
	sprite.setdirection(0)
    sprite.move(10)
```

and try pressing w to make the sprite move up, nothing will happen. this is because when we run the code, the program will only check for this condition once and never again. to make it keep on checking we need to encompass all our code that will be have controls over the game in a loop that doesnt end until the game ends. and we can use while loops to do so like this:

```
while True:
  if stage.iskeypressed("w"):
    sprite.setdirection(0)
    sprite.move(10)
```
Now when we run the code, everytime we click w, the sprite will move upwards.

## **6. Homework

Students create a simple game scene where the sprite moves in different directions using keyboard inputs.

Bonus point for creating a key input to end the game.
