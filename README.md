This is the Codex, your entrance into my teaching materials in this vault. This is the author speaking, [[Ahmed Fathy]] . This is just a linking file to take you around the teaching Materials.

# **Topics

## [[1.Introduction To Python]]

```
This section will introduce the students to python and coding as a whole. it will introduce the environment to said students and then introduce them basic syntax in python with print staments also convered. It will also brush onto indentation as it is a big part of python.
```
## [[2.Variables and Data Types]]

```
Discusss with the students the creation and usage of variables. it will then go over and help in the facilitation of the understanding of Data Types and their Differences.
```
## [[3.Basic Operators & String Manipulations]]

```
In this lesson, basic operators will be discussed in the addition of strings. Working with variables will be covered here too. The operators covered are the basic ones, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and Module. Lastly, a brief covering of string manipulation and its rules.
```
## [[4.Inputs & Outputs]]

```
As the title states. in this lesson inputs & outputs will be covered. Firstly how to input will be gone over then outputting right after since you need both toggether. Lastly we go onto manipulating those inputs and outputting them.
```
## [[5.Conditional Statements]]
```
In this lesson, an overview of conditionals will be gives, those inclue Ifs, Elses, ElIfs and Switches.  Then using them with variables will be shown.
```
## [[6.Loops]]

```
An Overview of loops will be given in this lesson, those being for loops, while loops and do while loops. Then integrating them with previous lessons such as Conditionals, variables and inputs and outputs will be done.
```
## [[7.Functions]]

```
Going over how to do functions in python will be covered in this lesson. this will go over functions with and without parameters, functions with and without returns and recursive functions. 
```
## [[8.Data Structures]]

```
Will be going over Arrays, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, & Sets. Their similarites and differences will be shown and their use cases will be covered. And using data structures with arrays will be covered after.
```
## [[9.Modules & Libraries]]

```
Modules and Libraries and what they are and how they are imported and used will be covered here. Also a discussion on how functions and modules & libraries are different.
```
## [[10.Introduction to Game Development]]

```
Introduction to the environment and outputs of the environment. Sprites and maps will be covered here. Movement , direction and speed will be also shown here.
```
## [[11.Make a Simple Game]]

```
Using previous and new kowledge of collision and winning conditions, we will make a simple maze game here
```
## [[12.Create The Game]]

```
The final lession, you will use a lot of the previous knowledge to create a flappy bird game, which will also be using the new knowledge of score and lose screens.
```
