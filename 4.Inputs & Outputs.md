#Lesson

## What will be covered in lessons?

- Show how to input in python
- Discuss its rules
- Output the results from the Input
- Manipulate and use the input elsewhere


## **1. What is input in Python.

Lets say you want the user of your program to enter their own data depending on what you want from them. all of what we have done thus far has been us putting the values we need manually in the code itself, but what if we want it to be different depending on the user or change it every time we run the program.

to get inputs in python we simply need to use the input() function.

an example of it would be like this:

```
name = input("Enter your name")
print("Hello " + name)
```

the "Enter your name" will display that message for the user when the program is ran. it is good to include something like that for the user so they know what to do give. it could also be written normally like so.

```
print("Enter your name")
name = input()
print("Hello " + name)
```
and it would act like the previous code. but the input would be on a new line rather than the same line as the message printed.

##  **2. Rules of input()

lets look at this example 
```
age = input("How old are you? ") 
print("You are " + age + " years old.") # Note: `age` is treated as a string.
```

but if we want the age to actually be a number we have to use this:

```
age = int(input("How old are you? ")) 
print("In 5 years, you will be", age + 5)
```

and as you can see we can change it too like variables of course because it is also a variable.

## **3. Outputting more inputs

we can work with inputs to do whatever our heart desires, a simple addition program can be done like this
```
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
result = number1 + number2
print("The result of adding the two numbers is:", result)
```

so you can see how useful this is, you can re run  the program and insert different values and get different results, and then you can see how this can be used to make something like a simple calculator.

We can also do string manipulations that python gives us access to. two examples of this is to find the length of a string or to upper or lower case a string. look at the code below:
```
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ") 
print("Uppercase:", sentence.upper()) 
print("Length of your sentence:", len(sentence))
```


## **4. Recap

In this lesson we covered how to input and output data and how to use our input data in various ways.

### **5. Homework**

- Write a Python program that:
    - Asks for your name, favorite number, and favorite color.
    - Converts the favorite number to an integer, doubles it, and prints it back to the user.
    - Manipulates the color by printing it in uppercase.
    - Make a simple calculator
