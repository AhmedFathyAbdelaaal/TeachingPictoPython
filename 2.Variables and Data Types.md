#Lesson

## What will be covered in lessons?

- Create and name Variables
- Store values in variables
- Use variables in printing
- Discuss the Data Types
- Discuss their differences and Use Cases

## **1. What is a Variable

Hello and welcome back to the class everyone, today we are going to expand on what we learned from python in the previous class. previously we covered what python is and how to print things in python. all simple stuff. and today we will expand on it and use print for more things.

So, our topic for today is Variables & Datatypes. there is clearly two things here, variables and data types.  If you want the straight forward answer, variables are elements in your code that store variable or constant data. variable is like a box that contains items, and those items are the data that we generally use in the code. then Data types are the types of data that variables and data in general can be in in Python. and each data type has its rules and specifics that makes it that kind of data type.

so lets give some examples of variables then go over data types then loop back to variables after.

Look at this code:

```
name = "Ahmed"
Age = 20
```

in this code we have two variables, they are 'Name' & 'Age'. and you can see that the name stores the value of 'Ahmed' in it while the Age stores the number 20.  from these examples we can actually draw some conclusions regarding variables, they have a variable name, and a value that is stored into them. the name is what you will use to refer to them in the future and the value is what the name will refer to. so when i ask the program about 'name', it will give me 'Ahmed'.

## **2. Naming a Variable

We cant just name variables whatever we like, I mean we can, we just have to follow some rules those rules are

```
- Must Start with a letter or an Underscore (_)
- Cannot Contain spaces or start with numbers
- It is case sensitive, so 'Name' and 'name' are different variables
```

Do try to make your variables also meaningful, a variable that shows someone's name should have a name that shows that rather than something like 'x' or 'y' so anyone reading your code can understand it.

## **3. Using of Variables

So, lets use the variables we created earlier before we go over the different data types that exist.. So, we can print the variables just by mentioning it in the code, and the example below will show that. Look at this:

```
name = "Ahmed"
age = 20
print(name)
print(age)
```
and that will print out in the terminal:
```
Ahmed
20
```

So just by mentioning the name of the variable you can print it out. the beauty of variable is that you can use them as many times as you can, so you can print out something you would want to print out a lot just by referring to the name and that's all. 

Moreover variables allow for dynamic data changing. lets say you want to change the age of the user, you can just by changing the variable 'age' and all the references in the code will follow. So you don't have to change every single mention of the age, just the 'age' variable itself.
## **4. What are Data Types

Now that we covered a bit about variables and how to use them. now we can go over the various data types that can be used inside variables. Here are the most common types and the ones we will be using for our course.

**Strings**

We first have Strings, Strings are texts, and can contain anything generally. an example can be "Hello" or even "Hello World" or even "H". it can vary in size and content but the most important part is to involve the quotation marks.
```
Examples of a String (str): 

name = "Ahmed"
hobby = "I like gaming"
gender = "M"
```

**Integers**

Then we have integers, integers are whole numbers like 5, 100, 6 or 90. it has no decimals or fractions in it.
```
Examples of an Integer (int):

age = 23
count = 8
score = 12
```


**Float**

Then we have something similar to integers, float values. these are decimal values . something like 3.14 , 0.25 , 10.0 and the such.

```
Examples of a Float (float):

pi = 3.142
chance = 0.25
```

**Boolean**

Last data type we will cover is the Boolean data type. it just consists of true and false. 1 or 0. its quite simple but useful for conditionals later on.

```
Examples of Boolean (bool):

is_student = True
is_human = False
```
the true and false have to be written as 'True' and 'False'.

recap of the data types:

```
name = "Alice" # String 
age = 14 # Integer 
height = 5.4 # Float 
is_student = True # Boolean
```

## **5. Data Types Use Cases

**When to Use**:

- **Strings** for names or sentences.
- **Integers** for counting or whole numbers (age, number of items).
- **Floats** for decimal values (height, weight).
- **Booleans** for True/False situations (e.g., logged in or not).
---

As a recap, we covered what variables and data types are and where to use them. we saw how useful they may be and how to make use of them.

## Homework

Write a Python script that defines:

- Your name (as a string).
- Your age (as an integer).
- Whether you like Python (as a boolean, True or False).
- Print a sentence using these variables.
