## What will be covered in lessons?

- Explain how to make the flappy bird game
- Add a score to the game
- Add a losing screen.


## **1. **Introduction to Flappy Bird Game Mechanics**

- In this lesson, we will recreate the popular Flappy Bird game. The main objectives are to make a bird sprite that moves up and down, create pipes that appear randomly, and establish a scoring and losing system.

## **2. **Setting Up the Bird Sprite**

- **Initialize the bird sprite**: The bird will move based on key presses. You can set up the bird to jump when a specific key (e.g., the spacebar) is pressed and let gravity pull it down otherwise.
- Example code to set up the bird movement:

```
bird = Sprite('Bird')
gravity = -0.6
jump_strength = 12

def jump():
    if sprite.isKeyPressed('space'):
        bird.y += jump_strength

def apply_gravity():
    bird.y += gravity

# Inside the game loop:
while True:
    jump()
    apply_gravity()
```


## **3. Setting Up the Pipes**


## **4. Setting Up Collision
