	- Else
	- Elif
- Switch
- Using them with Variables.

### **1. What Are Conditionals?** (10 minutes)

- **Conditionals**: Statements that allow Python to make decisions based on certain conditions.
    
- **Conditions**: These are expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False`. Based on this, the program will execute a specific block of code.
    
- **Example**:
```
age = 18 
if age >= 18:     
	print("You are an adult!")
```

as you see in the code, here is where indentation is very important, because if you dont involve it, it will not work. Thats how python work.

### **2. How to Use Conditionals: `if`, `else`, `elif`** (20 minutes)

 **If Statement**: The basic conditional statement in Python. It checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is `True`.
 
```
if (condition): 
	# Code to execute if condition is True
```

so an example of this would be:
```
temperature = 30 
if temperature > 25: 
	print("It's a hot day!")
```

there are rules when we are wrtiing if statments or conditionals in general. we have the 'if' itself, then we have the condition, you can put that in brackets or not, both work. then we need the colons ':' before going to what the conditional will do if the condition is met.

**Else Statement**: Adds an alternative block of code that will run if the `if` condition is `False`.
```
temperature = 15 
if temperature > 25: 
	print("It's a hot day!")
else: 
	print("It's a cool day!")
```

so, else will provide an alternative output if the condition in the if is not met.

then we have the elif.
**Elif Statement**: Checks additional conditions if the initial `if` condition is `False`. It stands for "else if." This is our way of adding multiple conditions rather than one true condition.

```
temperature = 20 
if temperature > 25: 
	print("It's a hot day!") 
elif temperature > 15: 
	print("It's a warm day!") 
else: 
	print("It's a cool day!")
```

so as you can see here, we have two conditions that we check for before resorting to the else.

but elifs are slow at times and bog down your program, if you have many conditions you would like to check then we can go to the next item.

## **3. Switch-Like Behavior in Python

lets say we have a message to display on some days of the week and another message for any day we dont care about to mention something special for. using elif  multiple times may be long for us, python allows us to use what is knows as dictionaries to make this simpler, look at the example below:

```
days = {
    "Monday": "Start of the week!",
    "Friday": "Almost weekend!"
}
print(days.get("Monday", "It's just another day."))
```

in this ccode, we get a day and if we dont find the day , we display the message on the side. the code follows something like this

```
print(day.get(condition,Message to display if false))
```

so if we do something like 
```
print(days.get("Tuesday", "It's just another day."))
```

the program would print out It's just another day

but this is a niche way of doing this and for a simple example like this with little conditoons we can simply use el if like so:

```
day = "Monday"
if day == "Monday":
    print("Start of the week!")
elif day == "Friday":
    print("Almost weekend!")
else:
    print("It's just another day.")
```

it is generally a personal preference, but it is nice to note as we will be using dictionaries later on in the course.

### **4. Using Conditionals with Variables** (15 minutes)

Combine variables and conditions to make decisions based on user input or program data.

```
number = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
if number > 0: 
	print("The number is positive.") 
elif number < 0: 
	print("The number is negative.") 
else: 
	print("The number is zero.")
```

This is a way for us to be able to use conditional while checking a variable we inputted when the program is ran. 

we can also use this to do specific actions like so:
```
option = int(input("Enter a number: 1. Add, 2. Subtract, 3. Multiply & 4. Divide")) 
if number == 1: 
	print("2 + 2 =".2+2) 
elif number ==2: 
	print("2-2 =".2-2) 
elif number ==3: 
	print("2*2 =", 2*2)
elif number ==4: 
	print("2/2 = ", 2/2)
else: 
	print("Invalid operation")
```

### **5. Homework**

- Write a Python program that:
    - Asks the user for their favorite color.
    - Uses conditionals to print specific messages based on the input color (e.g., if the color is blue, print "You like the sky!" or if itâ€™s red, print "You like fire!").
    - Design a calculate using conditionals with your inputs as the values used. and your input deciding which operation to do.
