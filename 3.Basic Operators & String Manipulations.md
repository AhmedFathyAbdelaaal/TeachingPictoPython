## **1.What are Operators

Operators are symbols that tell python how to perform specific tasks, examples of these tasks include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and a new one to you called module. 

```
Add: +
Subtract: -
Multiply: **
Divide: /
Module: %
```

## **2. Basic Arithmetic Operators

we will use variables here to give our examples
### Addition (+):

Addition is the adding of two number, those can be integers and floats. 

examples of it:
```
result = 5 + 3 # gives us output of 8
#or
result2 = 2.5 + 5.0 # gives us an output of 7.5
```

### Subtraction (-):

subtraction is the subtracting of two number, those can be integers and floats. 

examples of it:

```
result = 5 - 3 # gives us output of 2
#or
result2 = 6.0 - 1.4 # gives us an output of 4.6
```

### Multiplication ( * ):

Multiplication is when you multiply two numbers. this can also be integers and floats.

examples of it:

```
result = 5 * 3 # gives us output of 15
#or
result2 = 1.5 * 4 # gives us an output of 6.0
```


### Division (/):

Division is the dividing of two number, those can be integers and floats. 

examples of it:

```
result = 9 / 3 # gives us output of 3
#or
result2 = 6.0 / 1.5 # gives us an output of 4
```


### Modulus (%):

Modulus gives us the remainder of a division operation. an example of that is when we divide 5 by 2 we get 1 as a remainder. or when we divide 11 by 3 we get 2 as remainder.

examples of it:

```
result = 6 % 2 # gives us output of 0 because there is no remainder 
#or
result2 = 9 % 2 # gives us an output of 1 because there is 1 reminder.
#or
result3 = 9 % 1.5 # gives us the output of 0.0, it has a decimal because we used floats here
#or
result4 = 10%1.5 = 1.0 # gives us the output of 1.0, it has a decimal because we used floats here
```


## **3. String Manipulation

We can manipulate strings in python, manipulate texts in a way, and this can go very in depth but for this class we will be covering two simple examples of it, and later on we will cover more.

First we have what is known as Concatenation.

Concatenation (+) joins two strings, so basically is adds to texts back to back.

```
greeting = "Hello, " + "World`"
print(greeting)
```
in the example above, the output will be "Hello, World!". notice how we added a space in the first text. thats so the words dont merge together because if we didnt, they will still to each other since pythong wont add spaces for you. you have to add any spaces you need for yourself.

You can extrapolate this further and make variables that contain strings and add these string together to concatenate. it would look something like this
```
firstName = "Ahmed"
lastName = "Me"

fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
#the " " is added to add a space between the names.
```
and printing "fullName" would give us the two name together as "Ahmed Me".

 The second form of string manipulation we can use is repetition. and while using this at times seems useless, it is nice to know nonetheless. 
Repetitions  (&)  repeats a string with how many times it was given.

```
name = "Hamada"
result = name * 6
```
printing result would give us something like "HamadaHamadaHamadaHamadaHamadaHamada"

Notice how since we didn't add a space in "name", the names are sticking together when we repeated them.

## **4. Using Varying operators together

You can use multiple operators in one code line to give you the result you need. but to do so you need to know about order of operations, or how school refer to them as BODMAS. BODMAS stands for 

Brackets
Operations
Division
Multiplication
Addition
Subtraction.

We can ignore Operations for the sake of this course but it is similar to multiplication. Divison and Multiplication are interchangable and Additions and Subtraction are interchangable but Divison & Multiplication is always above Addition & Subtractions.

But what does that all mean, well it means that the order the program and you too should do these operators should follow that order. its easier to explain with an example.

```
Lets say we have this:
5 + 3 * 7

what would the answer be, well according to BODMAS we fist need to see if there are any brackets, since there are not, we then look for any multiplication or divison, which we do have here with '3*7' , so after we do that we get 21 and then the operation becomes

5 + 21

and then since there is only addition left we then can do it simply and get 26.

if we were to do 5+3 first and get 8, then we multiply 8 with 7 to get 56, our answer would be wrong. and you can  see the answer differs depending on the order you do your operations in
```

an example to showcase how multiplication and division don't matter in order would be something like this:
```
10 * 6 / 3 

we can do this by doing 6*10 = 60 and then 60/3 = 20
or we can do this by doing 6/3 = 2 and then 2 * 10 = 20.

as you can see we got the same answer regardless of which we did first. 
THis rule applies also for addition and subtraction.
```

We now have to see something that we have been avoiding, brackets. brackets are important in operations because they have the highest priority, so you can use them to decide what happens first. lets look at the first example.
\
```
5 + 3 * 7 would give us 26 in the way that it is.
but if we add a bracket like so:
(5 + 3) * 7
since the brackets hold the highest priority, we need to do what is inside of them then what is connected to them then whatever else exists. so we now have to do it as 5+3 = 8 then we will have 
(8) * 7 and then we get 56 as a result.
```

so you can use brackets to order and make sure your operations work well.

So now that you have seen all of that, you can see how we can add operators together into one code line or one variable 

```
num_1 = 5 + 3 * 7
```
is an example of a valid variable in python that will give us 26 as a result

```
num_2 = (5+3) * 7
```
is an example of using brackets to get the result we need in a variable.

```
num_3 = (5+3) * 7 + 10 - 9/3 
```

is also a valid example.

## **5. Recap

So, in this lesson we covered what are operators, how do they work, string manipulation and operations orders. we also saw how variables can be used here to make things easier and it is recommended to use them for ease of use later on.


### **6. Homework**

- Write a Python script that:
    - Performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) with two numbers.
    - Concatenates two strings and repeats the resulting string.
    - Accesses the first and last characters of a string and prints a slice of it.
