### **1. What is Python

- Python is a widely-used, easy-to-learn programming language.

- Python is widely used nowadays in data science, game development, machine learning and even web development, and more.

- While python is one of the easier languages  to learn due to its simplicity, it also used by a lot of professionals in a lot of industries due to how useful it is.

Hello kiddos, today we are going to be diving into the world of python and coding as a whole and i hope you are excited. coding is such a big part of our life nowadays but its often invisible, your laptop, your computer, your phone or even tablet. all of technology is all built on coding. its such a vast and useful component of our daily lives and hence learning even a bit of it is useful.

Coding is a general term but what is it? Well, your computer doesn't speak English or Arabic or any of our languages like me and you. the computer has its own language made up of instructions sent to it and those instructions and in bits, those are 1s and 0s. But we don't speak ones and zeroes. so smart people decided, we will write code in a way we understand, and then have a program translate it to be able to be run by computers. These translators are often called compilers but what you should know is, coding for us humans consists of us writing instructions that the computer will do in a language we understand and can learn, and the translation is done without us caring about it as long as we follow the language rules.

So overall, coding is our way of writing instructions that the computer should do. With coding, there are many languages one can use for coding, some do specific things or work in specific environments. and for this course we will be covering Python. Python is the most popular language in the world currently due to its ease of use and usefulness. Python is widely used nowadays in web development, game development, machine learning and data science and more. Its ease of use allowed more people to learn it and for it to evolve more. 

Python is a good starting programming language and it is useful even in the future for professionals because even when it is a simple and easy language, a lot of companies and professionals use it because of its usefulness.  (examples like google, Netflix, Spotify, Instagram etc.)

### **2. Setting Up the Python Environment

So now that we know what python is, we now need to figure out how to use it and where to write our code. We will be using a a program known as Pictorblox to do all our coding, it is a cute and simple software that will allow us to learn coding and later on even embark on game development adventures. So lets install it. 

We search for Pictoblox Download, we download it, or we can even use their online website pictoblox.ai . both work. After doing so you will see this interface in front of you.

What we are interested in right now is the coding section to the left and we will ignore the right side for now as it is of no interest to us. We can write out code their and we can run it below by clicking the *run* button. and we shall get to that after this.

### **3. Basic Syntax & Print Statements

Now that  we have our environment, lets start with the simplest coding example. Lets make our machine display Hello world in the terminal. now with python being an easy language, it simply just requires us to write:
```
print("Hello World")
```

*Provide more examples*

and when we run the code it will print it out in the terminal below. but lets study this code a bit more. it is made up of two sections, the instruction and the message. the instruction is 'Print' and the message is ' "Hello World" '. you will also notice that we need the quotation marks around the message for it to display and if we don't, the program has an error. this is because the message that we are trying to display is known as a string, strings are made-up of characters and characters are single letters, numbers and sign etc, we will cover all of that in more detail in later lessons too. its just nice to know if you want to display a text like that, you have to put the quotation marks like that following this example.

the instruction part though is more interesting, 'Print' is built-in function in python, this is made for us so we don't have to write even longer code, all we have to do is use print and it does all the work of outputting to the terminal what we wanted it to do.

Python has a lot of these built in functions and we will cover them as we continue this course in the future, for now though we only need to use and care about print.

### **4. Introduction to Indentation

The last part we will cover in today's lesson is something known as indentation. Python isn't like other programming languages. most languages don't use this and use brackets to organize their codes. but python uses what is known as indentation.  Indentation is basically pushing the text in with spaces or tab clicks and it looks like this:
![[Pasted image 20240910020020.png]]

Indentation is important because the wrong indentation like above would cause the program to not work because python thinks the second line is part of the first one but it cant because print doesn't work like that. and all of this just throws the compiler off and it doesn't work as intended and doesn't function. So for now we will keep all  our code lines aligned and well, with no indentation. later on though some code lines will require us to indent for them to work. and when we reach there we will know of it too.

### **5. Recap & Q&A

So overall, we covered what coding is as a while and gave a small intro to python. then we went over how to write simple code in python with a few examples. then we covered how indentation works in python and why its important. All of this will be added upon in the next lessons and improved upon. so keep this in mine

## **Homework:


write print statements about you, make it cover what your name is, how old are you, what are your hobbies and what do you like to do. Bonus points for making it pretty and even more bonus points for making special shapes using print after.
