#Lesson

## What will be covered in lessons?

- Explain how to make a maze game.
- Explain how to detect collisions
- Show how to add a win condition.
## 1. Setting up the Maze 

To make a maze game you need a few components
- Character and Map
- Movement
- Collision
- Win Condition
### Sprite & Map Selection 
- Choose a player sprite (e.g., Tobi). 
- Create a backdrop for the maze. 

```
# Initialize the player sprite (crab) 
sprite = Sprite('crab')
```

```
stage = Sprite('maze')
```

## **2. Making the Movement

We utilize the isKeyPressed here to make it happen.

```
while True:
	if stage.iskeypressed("w"):
	  sprite.setdirection(0)
	  sprite.move(1)
	  
	if stage.iskeypressed("a"):
	  sprite.setdirection(-90)
	  sprite.move(1)
	  
	if stage.iskeypressed("s"):
	  sprite.setdirection(180)
	  sprite.move(1)
	  
	if stage.iskeypressed("d"):
	  sprite.setdirection(90)
	  sprite.move(1)
```

This is based off what we did in the previous lesson, the speed is 1 but you can change it, but unlike previous lesson, 10 was too fast.

## **3.Adding Collision with Walls

We utilize a function knows as "istouchingcolor" since all the walls are black, we can use that to detect it.

the color inside is represented on the RGB spectrum. black on that spectrum is 0,0,0

so if we want to detect it, we use conditionals too to see it, and we write it as such

```
	if sprite.istouchingcolor((0,0,0)):
```

and inside we now get to decide what happens when the player touches the wall. you can make it say something or reset the player. to make it simple we will reset the player at the beginning of the game like so:
```
	if sprite.istouchingcolor((0,0,0)):
	  sprite.gotoxy(-140,-165)
	  sprite.setdirection(0)
```

## **4. Adding Winning Condition

Now to win, we need a message to appear when the character reaches the end goal. we can use the same logic of touching a color to also do the same, but in this map, the endgoal is red, its an apple, so we just have to find the color code for that and change it and change the code inside the if statement to end the game.

red's color code is 255,0,0

so it would look like that:
```
	if sprite.istouchingcolor((255,0,0)):
```

now to make it say a message we change it into that:
```
	if sprite.istouchingcolor((0,0,0)):
	  sprite.say("YOU DID IT",5)
```
but that's not the only thing we want to do, we also want to do. we want the game to end which means we need to get out of the loop. and we can do that with "break"

so it will end up looking like this

```
	if sprite.istouchingcolor((0,0,0)):
	  sprite.say("YOU DID IT",5)
	  break
```


## **5.Homework

Finish the Maze.
