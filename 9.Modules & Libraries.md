## What will be covered in lessons?

- Explain what are modules & Libraries
- Explain Differences with Functions
- Example of using functions from modules and libraries.


### **1. What are Modules & Libraries? **

**Explanation:**

- A **module** is a file containing Python code that you can import into your program. It can include functions, variables, and classes.
- A **library** is a collection of modules. Libraries offer ready-made functionalities that you can use in your programs without writing them from scratch.
- Python comes with built-in modules like `math` or `random`, and you can also install third-party libraries like `numpy` or `pandas`.
example of a commonly used module:

```
import math
print(math.sqrt(25))  # Outputs: 5.0
```


### **2. Differences Between Functions, Modules, and Libraries**

**Explanation:**

- **Functions**: Pieces of reusable code that perform specific tasks within a program.
- **Modules**: Files containing functions and other code that can be reused across multiple programs.
- **Libraries**: Collections of multiple modules that provide extended functionality, often for specific purposes (like data analysis or web development).

**Example:**

- A function is like a tool in a toolbox (e.g., a hammer).
- A module is like a whole toolbox with multiple tools (e.g., a toolset for basic repairs).
- A library is like a full workshop filled with toolboxes for many different tasks.

| **Feature**                |                 **Functions**                 |                      **Modules**                      |                                    **Libraries**                                     |
| -------------------------- |:---------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Definition**             | A block of reusable code for a specific task. |  A file containing multiple functions and variables.  |              A collection of modules providing extended functionality.               |
| **Purpose**                |   To perform a specific task or operation.    | To organize and reuse code across different programs. | To offer ready-made tools for specific tasks (e.g., data analysis, web development). |
| **Contains**               |         Code that performs one task.          |          Functions, variables, and classes.           |               Multiple modules that can be imported and used together.               |
| **Examples**               |         `def add(a, b): return a + b`         |         `import math` (e.g., `math.sqrt(16)`)         |                  `import numpy as np` (e.g., `np.array([1, 2, 3])`)                  |
| **Scope of Use**           |         Used within the same program.         |     Can be imported and used in various programs.     |         Provides tools for a broad range of functionalities across programs.         |
| **Creation**               |    Defined in a single program or script.     |    Created by saving a `.py` file with functions.     |            Usually installed and maintained separately (e.g., via `pip`).            |
| **Reusability**            |    Can be reused within the same program.     |        Can be reused across multiple programs.        |                Provides reusable code and tools across many projects.                |
| **Installation Required?** |        No (written by the programmer).        | No (usually part of Python's built-in functionality). |          Sometimes (third-party libraries need to be installed via `pip`).           |


### **3. Using Functions from Modules and Libraries**

**Explanation:**

- Python has built-in modules (e.g., `random`, `os`) and third-party libraries that you can install via `pip`.
- You can call functions from these modules by importing them into your code.
```
import random
print(random.randint(1, 10))  # Outputs a random integer between 1 and 10
```

### **4. Practice and Homework

**Explanation:**

- Students explore other common built-in modules (like `time` and `datetime`) and write small programs using them.

**Homework:**

- Ask students to find a module or library they find interesting and write a simple script using one or two functions from it.
