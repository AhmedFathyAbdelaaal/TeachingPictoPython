- Explain Arrays and the lists etc.
- Show their differences
- Show their use cases
- Show examples of each
- How to loop through arrays


### **1. What are Data Structures?**

- **Data structures** are ways to store and organize data in a program.
    
- They help you keep your data organized and make it easy to access or modify.
    
- **Real-life example**: Think of a data structure like a shopping list. It keeps track of what you need, and you can easily add or remove items.

### **2. Lists (Arrays)**

**What is a List?**

- A list is a collection of items (or elements) stored in a particular order.
- Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python.

**Key Points**:

- Lists can store multiple items in a single variable.
- You can store different types of data (integers, strings, etc.) in a list.
- Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents (add, remove, or modify items).

an example would be 

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
```
and if we do something like 
```
print(fruits[1])
print(fruits[2])
```

we will get banana for the first one and cherry for the number 2.

you will notice in here in this list we started with 0 and not 1. and this is because this is how coding starting counting things in data structures, it goes from 0 and not from 1. this will also apply to the other data structures we will look at after  this

## **3. Tuples

- **What is a Tuple?**
    
    - A tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable (you cannot change the values once they are set).
    - Use tuples when you need to store a fixed set of values that won’t change.
```
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates[0])  # Output: 10
```
**Key Points**:

- Tuples are often used for data that is constant throughout the program (e.g., coordinates, constant settings).
- Syntax is similar to lists but uses parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.

## **4. Dictionaries

**What is a Dictionary?**

- A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs. Think of it as a real-life dictionary where each word (key) has a definition (value).
- Keys must be unique, and values can be of any data type.

So dictionaries consist of two data elements per data entry, a key that identifies the data and  a value that is associated with the key.

```
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 14, "grade": "9th"}
print(student["name"])  # Output: Alice
```
**Key Points**:

- Use dictionaries when you need to associate keys with values (e.g., storing details of students, products, etc.).
- Dictionaries are mutable—you can add, remove, or modify key-value pairs.

## **5. Differences Between Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

- **List**: Ordered, mutable, allows duplicate items.
- **Tuple**: Ordered, immutable, allows duplicate items.
- **Dictionary**: Unordered, mutable, stores key-value pairs, keys must be unique.


the table below has detailed explanation:

| **Feature**                       |                 **Lists**                  |                  **Tuples**                  |                           **Dictionaries**                            |
| --------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Mutable** (Can modify elements) |                    Yes                     |                      No                      |                                  Yes                                  |
| **Ordered**                       |    Yes (elements maintain their order)     |     Yes (elements maintain their order)      |            Yes (Python 3.7+ ensures ordered by insertion)             |
| **Indexed**                       |        Yes (indexed starting at 0)         |         Yes (indexed starting at 0)          |                        No (accessed via keys)                         |
| **Syntax**                        |            Square brackets `[]`            |               Parentheses `()`               |                Curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs                 |
| **Duplicates allowed**            |                    Yes                     |                     Yes                      |          No (keys must be unique, values can be duplicates)           |
| **Types of values**               |        Can contain mixed data types        |         Can contain mixed data types         | Keys: immutable types (e.g., strings, numbers); Values: any data type |
| **Looping**                       |         Can loop through elements          |          Can loop through elements           |                Can loop through keys, values, or both                 |
| **Access Elements**               |        Access by index (`list[0]`)         |         Access by index (`tuple[0]`)         |                     Access by key (`dict['key']`)                     |
| **Use Case**                      |   Best for dynamic collections of items    |     Best for fixed collections of items      |        Best for mapping relationships (e.g., key-value pairs)         |
| **Immutability**                  | Mutable (can add, remove, or change items) | Immutable (cannot be changed after creation) |                  Mutable, but keys must be immutable                  |
| **Adding Elements**               | `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()` methods |     Not possible (tuples are immutable)      |             `dict[key] = value` to add or update elements             |
| **Removing Elements**             |        `remove()`, `pop()`, `del()`        |     Not possible (tuples are immutable)      |                       `del dict[key]`, `pop()`                        |


## **6. Looping Through Lists

Looping lets you go through each item in a list (or array) one by one.
```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```


The `for` loop goes through each item in the list and prints it.

### **7. Looping Through Tuples** (5-10 minutes)

- **Why loop through tuples?**: Even though tuples are immutable, you can still access their elements using loops.
```
coordinates = (10, 20, 30)
for coord in coordinates:
    print(coord)
```

- - Similar to lists, tuples can be looped through using a `for` loop. Since tuples are immutable, their values can only be read, not changed.

### **8. Looping Through Dictionaries** (10-15 minutes)

- **Why loop through dictionaries?**: You can loop through a dictionary to access its keys, values, or both.

Through Keys:
```
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 14, "grade": "9th"}
for key in student:
    print(key)
```

Through Values:
```
for value in student.values():
    print(value)
```

Through Both:
```
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

you can see to get the keys we didnt need to add a specifier but to get th values we needed to use the '.values' specifier and to get both keys and values we needed to use the '.items' specifier.

### **9. Homework**

- **Part 1**: Create a list of five items, then loop through the list to print each item.
- **Part 2**: Create a tuple containing your three favorite numbers and loop through it to print each one.
- **Part 3**: Create a dictionary to store information about your favorite movie (e.g., title, year, genre), then loop through the dictionary to print both the keys and values.
