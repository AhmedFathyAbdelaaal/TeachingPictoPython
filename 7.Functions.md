#Lesson

## What will be covered in lessons?

- Explain Functions
- Show their structure and explain their usage
- Show functions with and without parameters
- Return with functions
- Explain what a recursive function is

## **1.What is a Function

A function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task. It allows you to write code once and use it whenever needed, avoiding repetition.

Think of a function like a recipe for making cake. or anything really. instead of you writing the recipe down every time you are going to use it, you just write it once and refer to it when you need it, and this recipe will tell you what do to step by step. functions are alike in that sense, they are a code block of instructions that you can refer to at any time.

Functions help with:

- Code Reusability
- Organization
- Modularity: the breaking of complex problems into smaller more manageable parts.


## **2. Structure of a Function

So, how do we do functions in python, well, it looks like this:

```
def function_name():
    # Code to execute
```

def stands for define here, we are defining the function with this keyword.

function_name is the name of the function of course, should be something related to what the function does.

() hold the parameters if any, these can be like ingredients or data the function uses. we will cover more of this later.

: similar to how loops or conditionals are.

A simple example of this, we can make a function that greets whenever it is called upon.

```
def greet():
    print("Hello, welcome to Python!")
```

and to call this function in our code it will be like this:
```
greet()
```

and we can do it again and again and we can easily print the message in the function

```
greet()
greet()
greet()
greet()
```
would print the message 4 times. and we don't have to write it all over and over again.

## **3. Functions with Parameters 

Functions can take inputs, called parameters, which allow the function to operate on different data each time it's called. and it looks something like this

```
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
    # Code to execute
```

Notice how here we have parameter1 and parameter2 inside the brackets, those will house the data we will send to the function. an example  of this would be something like this:

```
def greet(name):
    print("Hello", name, "!")

greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
```
In this example, we are sending a different name each time we are runing the function, so we can have it greet different people all while using the same function just changing the name we give it.
So if you would like imagine an app that says hello to the user with their name beside it, this is generally how they would do it. using variables and functions and the such.

## **4. Return Values from Functions

Sometimes we want a function to return us an output or a result and we work with it in the main code. we can do that by using something known as return and it looks like this.

```
def function_name():
    return value
```

but we cant just call this like previously. lets say we have this:

```
def greet(name):
	greeting = "Hello There " + name
	return greeting
```

```
greet("Hamada") # This doesnt work
```
we need the returned value to go back into something. this can come in a few forms, two of which you can either store the returned value in a variable, or use it in something such as a print statement. both examples below

```
theGreeting = greet("Hamada")
```
```
print(greet("Hamada"))
```

and both of these work. one will store it in a variable that can be used later. while the other prints the result.

## **5. Recursive Functions

This is going to be a quick section, but it is important for later on. What is recursion? and what is a recursive function?

A recursive function is a function that calls itself. It can be useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems (like finding the factorial of a number or calculating Fibonacci numbers).

So in the function, it will keep on calling the function over and over again till it is done. an example of that as mentioned above is factorials. factorials are the multiplication of all the numbers before a number with that number. example of this would be.

4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24

and as you can see, the numbers can be made to be related, the number after 4 is just 4 -1 and the number after than is that subtracted number -1 until you reach one. How this would be implemented in code would look something like this:

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Outputs: 120
```

and how this works is that , When calling `factorial(5)`, it multiplies `5 * factorial(4)`... and so on until it reaches `factorial(1)` which returns `1`.

## **6. Homework

Write a function that:

- Takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two.
- Write a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
- Ask students to write a recursive function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to the given number (like `sum(5)` returns `5+4+3+2+1`).
- Have students create a function that calculates and returns the area of a rectangle based on the width and height given as parameters.
- Let students create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and prints their sum.
- Have students create their own function that prints a welcome message or a fun fact.
